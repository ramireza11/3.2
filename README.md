### #Coding

> I would like to make a boss throw objects at your character which you will have
to dodge them or else it's game over for you. I don't know how ill do it but it
will just be an overlapping thing that makes it fast and faster after each level.

For assets, I will like to bring along my artwork and make all the objects
characters. I will like to have a vintage vibe to the game as well.

> I will be testing each time I make an edit. I do not want a game that doesn't
work and is always debugging. That's why I would like to test different ways of throwing the objects to make it better and what will work for my project.

I will love for everyone to have fun and just be happy playing the game.
